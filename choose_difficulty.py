# functions

# Choose difficulty function. The function asks the user a question (What difficulty would you like to play easy, medium, or hard.) and uses valid = False to make make while not valid = true which puts the component in a constant loop which only stops if the user does something that goes into the if block which has the return response which takes the program out of the function. The reason why the valid = false means true is because if it doesn't equal false it must equal true. It also uses .lower() to turn all upper case inputs into lower case leters
def Chosen_difficulty(question):
  # makes valid = false which makes while not valid mean while true because if its while not false that means it means while true.
  valid=False
  # while not valid (while true) loops the program
  while not valid:
    # response = input (question).lower() meaning that the users response equals the input to the question. The .lower() makes upper case inputs into lower case letters
    response = input (question) .lower()
