# functions 

# Played_before function. The function asks the user a question (Have you played the tereo maaori quiz before) and uses valid = False to make make while not valid = true which puts the component in a constant loop which only stops if the user does something that goes into the if block which has the return response which takes the program out of the function.

# It uses if, elif and else statements to execute a part of code if a condition is true. As you can see if the user types yes or y, it returns the users response (which makes the program exit the function and allows the program to move to the next thing). There is no return under the else statement because I want the quetion to repeat again if the user doesn something that falls into the else statement.
def played_before(question):

# Choose difficulty function. The function asks the user a question (What difficulty would you like to play easy, medium, or hard.) and uses valid = False to make make while not valid = true which puts the component in a constant loop which only stops if the user does something that goes into the if block which has the return response which takes the program out of the function. The reason why the valid = false means true is because if it doesn't equal false it must equal true. It also uses .lower() to turn all upper case inputs into lower case leters
def Chosen_difficulty(question):
  # makes valid = false which makes while not valid mean while true because if its while not false that means it means while true.

# lives_check function. The function asks the user a question (How many lives would you like to play with) and uses valid = False to make make while not valid = true which puts the component in a constant loop which only stops if the user does something that goes into the if block which has the return response which takes the program out of the function. The reason why the valid = false means true is because if it doesn't equal false it must equal true. It also uses try to check for errors and it also uses except ValueError to handle the error message

# It uses if and else statements to execute a part of code if a condition is true. As you can see if the user types a number between 1 and 10, the program will return the users response (which makes the program exit the function and allows the program to move to the next thing). There is no return under the else statement because I want the question to repeat again if the user does something that falls into the else statement. The function aslo only allows answers in integers and inputs an error if the user types something that isn't a integer (a integer is a whole number), or an iteger that isn't between 1 and 10.
def lives_check (question, low, high):
  # the error code that appears when the user types something that causes an error
  error = "please enter a whole number between 1 and 10\n"
  # valid = false which makes while not valid mean while true because if its while not false that means it means while true
  # valid = false which helps put the function in a loop
  valid = False
  # while not valid (while true) loops the program
  while not valid:
